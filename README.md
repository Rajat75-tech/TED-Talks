#TEDtalks UI
A simple, responsive user interface inspired by the TED Talks website. This project is built using pure HTML and CSS, and it demonstrates a clean, modern layout for showcasing video content and related information.

#Overview
The TEDtalks UI project recreates a user interface similar to the TED Talks homepage. It features a grid layout for videos, header and navigation sections, and a footer for additional links. The focus is on using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques (including Flexbox and/or CSS Grid) to create a responsive design that works well on different screen sizes.

#Features
Responsive Layout: Designed to adapt to various screen sizes—from mobile to desktop.
Semantic Markup: Uses HTML5 semantic elements for clear structure and accessibility.
Modern CSS Techniques: Utilizes Flexbox and/or CSS Grid for layout, along with CSS animations and transitions where appropriate.
Lightweight: No JavaScript; this project relies solely on HTML and CSS.
